                       In a consultation, audiologists often manage to gain the perspective of the parent or the teacher, but it is not as easy
                      to engage the child and gain their perspective in the rehabilitation process. In order to address the challenges of the hearing
                      loss in a holistic way, the child’s perspective is essential and central to effective management. The My World tool facilitates
                      an understanding of hearing loss from the child’s point of view. By manipulating the tool components and creating the scene
                      themselves, the child can externalize the hearing loss and discuss the successes and challenges related to communication
                      in a concrete and non-threatening way. This gives the child a voice and makes them an active participant in the rehabilitation
                      process. For the audiologist the tool facilitates open-ended questioning and provides a creative way to stimulate curiosity,
                      joint attention and shared understanding about aspects of communication most relevant to the child. The tool consists of
                      three different environments: A classroom, a home, and an outdoor area as well as a set of movable figures and everyday objects
                      that the child can use to describe communication successes and challenges in daily life.
